Command and Conquer 2013 Asset Pack v2
|------------------------------------------------------
Changelog for v2:

Extracted all models and textures for the Asia-Pacific_Alliance and European Union factions.
Added neutral Resourcecenter(missing textures for crates.)
Did some cleanup on few of the models, but found it time consuming so decided to focus on mainly extracting the assets.
Added a folder with image assets like icons, cursors and etc

Information:

This folder contains models and textures extracted from the cancelled game Command and Conquer Generals 2 / Command and Conquer 2013. 
As of writing this I have manged ot extract only some of the models because the rest require hex editing, but I am getting there. 
Folders that contain foldername(mesh) have only mesh files without textures.
Folders that contain foldername(textures) have only texture files without mesh.
For models without textures the reason is they have no texture files so I can't guarantee I can extract them.
For textures without mesh files I am slowly progressing with their extraction. 
I will do my best to include all mesh files like damaged/husk for units and damaged/husk/under construction for buildings if possible.
There are models that have rubble mesh inside them so they will need some cleaning up. I may do it myself, but for now my focus is mainly on getting all the assets.
